A production-ready personal portfolio built to showcase real-world full-stack engineering skills.

Backend API: Deployed & running (private)

##  Why This Portfolio Exists

This portfolio is designed to demonstrate **ownership of a complete system**, not just frontend visuals.

It shows:
- Real frontend engineering with React
- A live backend handling form submissions
- Email delivery for contact messages
- Environment-based configuration
- Deployment and debugging in production

This is how real applications work.

## Key Features

- **Dark / Light Mode** – Theme persistence with system preference detection
- **Animated UI** – Framer Motion based transitions and interactions

---

## Backend Capabilities (Important)

The “Get In Touch” section is **fully functional** and backed by a real API.

### Contact Flow
1. User submits the contact form
2. Frontend validates input
3. Request is sent to backend API
4. Message is stored securely
5. Email notification is sent to owner
6. User receives success / error feedback

This is **not a mock or dummy form**.
